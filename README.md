Attendance App 
==============
Attendance App is an Android app, combined with a simple server application in PHP and mySQL database to check student attendance at lectures.  
For the php server, check the **INSERT LINK** repository.

Problem
-------------
We often face a problem of checking attendance of the people at some event â€“ at lectures at the university, other events, even in companies they are checking when their employees are coming to work, going to lunch and when they are going home. 

In most cases, especially at university lectures, very outdated systems to check the attendance are being used. Usually a slate of paper is as high-tech as it gets...

Solution
------------
**AttendanceApp** is an Android app, used for scanning QR code at the lecture and thus confirming student's attendance at the lecture.  

It also has some safety swithces built-in, in order to prevent "fake" attendances - QR code needs to be scanned near to location
that lecturer entered as a location of the lecture. The location is checked by the cellular network (since GPS signal is usually weak
inside a lecture hall).
